**Hello**, my name is Cameron (or CKAY-9) and I am primarily a web developer; however, I do like to try out other things and have consistently come back to Minecraft plugins (lmao). Right now, I am just trying to get back into programming
and am rewriting some of my previous projects (now removed from GitHub) to completion.
